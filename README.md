# github actions gitmoji

To use this tool, simply add it to your Github repository and configure it to check for emoji in your PR titles. Once set up, the tool will automatically check each PR title and provide feedback if it does not contain an emoji. This can be a useful way to ensure that your PR titles are consistent with the Gitmoji convention and can help to improve the overall quality of your code.
